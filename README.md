# ðŸ“‰ Linear Regression ML Implementation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Linear Regression model from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand how the model works internally by manually computing gradients and optimizing weights using gradient descent â€” without relying on machine learning libraries for training.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression theory
- Loss Function (Mean Squared Error)
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Model Evaluation (RÂ² Score, RMSE)

---

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** â€“ For vectorized computations
- **Matplotlib** â€“ For visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For step-by-step explanation and testing

## ðŸ“‚ Notebook Summary
- Loads and visualizes a dataset
- Implements linear regression manually (no `scikit-learn`)
- Performs training using gradient descent
- Compares performance with `scikit-learn` implementation
- Plots actual vs. predicted values
